    <!-- as we know using that way for including scripts are not reliable, many a things can go wrong or updated and we'll have to constantly lookout for any changes 
        that being brought up by library developer and adjus accrodingly as wel in our script -->
    <!-- also if included in wrong order or if a dependency is missing aplication won't run, also unnecessary unused library dependency code will be downloaded hampering app overall performance -->
    <!-- we'll use webpack to manages these scripts instead to overcome all those above mentioned concurrencies -->
    <!-- we'll do so by creating a bundle, by tweaking our directory structure as it is now, with another folder called "dist"  where our distribution code wil be and used by our browser-->
    <!-- distribution code is minimized and optimized output for our build process that'll eventually be loaded in our browser -->
    <!-- we'll also move our index.html to ./dist later on we'll generate index.html rather than edit manulaly, once  this is done it should be safe to empty ./dist and regenerate all files within it -->
