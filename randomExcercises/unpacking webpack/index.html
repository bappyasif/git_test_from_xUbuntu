    when ever this directory gets shared just simply share .json file and after that recievers can just simply type in "npm install" to get a kickstart-->

    <!-- even that can get monotonous as we have to manually dig through node_modules and find our inteneded file and add it in layout
    and that's where module bundlers comes in handy to automate that process of adding it into html layout-->
    <!-- originally JS wasn;t meant to import code from another file as it was meant to run on browser only so it had no access client file system due to securty reasons -->
    <!-- when we were actually adding moment.min/js it was adding a global variable named "moment" which is available after any file loaded after moment.min.js file, whether they require it or not-->
    <!-- CommonJS let us import and export files across most PL without have to resorting to global variables, most well known CommonJS modules is nodeJS -->
