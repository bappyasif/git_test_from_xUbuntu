        // it's pattern is similarr to constructors but instead of using "new" to create an object
        // factory function simply sets up and return new object when called upon this function:
        let personFactory = (name, age) => {
            let sayHello = () => console.log("hello");
            return { name, age, sayHello };
        }
        let claire = personFactory("Claire", 29);
        console.log(claire.name, claire.age);
        claire.sayHello();

        // same functionality using Constructor:
        let Person = function (name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.sayHello = function () {
                console.log("Hello");
            }
        }
        claire = new Person("Claire", 29);
        console.log(claire.name, claire.age);
        claire.sayHello();

        // Object shorthand, 
        // return {name:name, age:age, sayHello:sayHello}  // without shorthand
        // return {name,age,sayHello} // with shorthand, when variable name is exactly same as property name
        let name = "Baeebee";
        let color = "purple";
        let number = 34;
        let food = "continental";
        // without using object syntax
        console.log(name, color, number, food);
        // with using object syntax where it will turn those variables into an object and seems to be much more intellegible
        console.log({ name, color, number, food });

        // In JavaScript, any function can return a new object, when it's not a constructor function or class, it's known as a factory function
        // Difference is Coonstructors/Class force callers to use "new" where Factories don't, it has relevant side effects:
        // - instantiates a new instance object and binds "this" to it within constructor
        // - binds instance.__proto__ to Constructor.prototype
        // - as a side effect of "2" binds instance.__proto__.constructor to Contructor
        // - implicitly returns "this" which reffers to instance
        // Refactoring example from class to factory implementation:
        // class Car {
        //     drive() {console.log("vroom vroom")}
        // }
        // let car = new Car();
        // car.drive();
        // let autoMaker = {Car};
        // autoMaker.drive();

        // refactoring using factory function:
        let autoMaker = {
            car(bundleType) {
                return Object.create(this.bundle[bundleType]);
            },
            bundle: {
                premium: {
                    drive() { console.log("vroom vroom") },
                    getOptions: function () { return ["leather", "wood", "pearl", "sea green"] }
                }
            }
        };
        // implementations expects a bundleType
        let car = autoMaker.car("premium");
        car.drive();
        // car =  new autoMaker.car(); // will throw undefined error

        // constructors enables deceptive instanceof: instanceof is a prototypee identity check not a a type check:
        function foo() { }
        let bar = { a: "a" };
        foo.prototype = bar;
        // console.log(bar instanceof foo, foo instanceof bar); // false, not callable
        console.log(bar instanceof foo); // false
        let baz = Object.create(bar);
        console.log(baz instanceof foo) // true?!, as mentioned earlier not a type check rather identity check
        // instanceof does an identity check, comparing object's __proto__ "object" to Contructor.prototype "property"
        // it also doesn't work if Constructor.prototype property gets replaced and not manually adjusted accordingly

        // benefits of using factories:
        // - return any arbitary object and use any arbitary prototype which allows more flexible prototypal inheritance models
        // - no refoactoring worries whatsoever, it's usually other way around from constructor/class implementation to factory function
        // - no "new" is required, as "new" is ambiguous to classical Class styled archetecture in JS
        // - quite standard "this" behavior, "this" refers to caller as anyother invocation method would, also you reassiging with call(..) and apply(..) possible and gets expected outcome
        // - no deceptive "instanceof" behavior, because it implicitly returning constructing object with it's prototype included
        // - its simpler expression without have to use of "new" while creting any objects, there is a nice tone to it as well

        // Scope and Closure, to understand and using Factory Function more readily and effortlessly, concept of "Scope" and "Closure" is paramount
        // what do you think this following snippet output will be on last line:
        let a = 17;
        let func = x => {
            // a = x; // changes global scoped variable
            let a = x; // changes locally, globally unaffected
            // console.log(a, window.a); // previously it was accessible but due to stop complications and better usage of function scope it's better to use local variables iinstead or use global variable directly
        };
        func(99); // to avoid any scoping misuse try using "use strict" this will prevent from creating root level scoped vriables
        console.log(a); // 17 but not 99 due to "scope" of variable "a"
        // Scoping means where these variables are available to access, usually ther function scoped otherwise globally scoped
        // if you need something outsidef of a function that might need to have ccess of we can return it from function and save it in a variable
        // also there is a significant difference in "var" and "let" scopes, "var" is gobally scope whereas "let" is scoped to its closest curly braces
        let yrs = 110;
        if (yrs > 12) {
            // var dogYrs = console.log("In dog years : "+yrs*7);
            let dogYrs = console.log("In dog years : " + yrs * 7);
            console.log(dogYrs); // "let" is scoped to it's nearest curly braces
        }
        // console.log(dogYrs); // "var" is scoped globally

        // Private Variables and Functions:
        let FactoryFunction = string => {
            let capitalString = () => string.toUpperCase();
            let printString = () => console.log(capitalString());
            return { printString };
        }
        let taco = FactoryFunction("taco");
        // printString(); // Error out of scope
        // capitalString(); // Error out of scope
        // taco.capitalString(); // Error out of scope
        taco.printString(); // accessible due to closure
        // concept of Closure is an Idea that functions retains their scopes even if they are passed around and called outside of that scope
        // printString() has access to capitalString() even if it gets called outside of that function
        let counterCreator = () => {
            let count = 0;
            return () => {
                console.log(count);
                count++;
            };
        };
        let counter = counterCreator();
        counter(); // 0
        counter(); // 1
        counter(); // 2
        counter(); // 3
        // counterCreator()() // 0, it stays same  unleess you want to change it's value over time or calling many times then have to use it like earlier way
        // in that example counterCreator(..) creates a local count variable and then returns a function, to use that function we've to assign it to a variable and then invoke it or alternatively use immediately invokeed functions (e.g.() after counterCreater()())
        // counter(..) is calling return value of counterCreator().. and thus confirming count state to be chaged over time when calling multiple times
        // function counter() is a closure, it has acccess to variable "count" and can both print and increment,, but there is no other way too acccess it from outside that function
        // factory functions allows us to create "private" variables and functions and only export methods that rest of our prgrams is going to use
        // using factory function terminology we can say capitalizeString() is a "private" method where as printString() is a "public" method
        // concept of "private" methods is very useful and should be used as often as possible, it easier to reason about for you and others to use your objects that you returned instead all of your available methods tucking it away for safety and maintainability

        // More about Factory Functions, factories are plain old JavaScript that return objects for us to use in our code:
        let Player = (name, level) => {
            let health = level * 2;
            let getLevel = () => level;
            let getName = () => name;
            let die = () => {
                console.log("character dead");
            };
            let damage = x => {
                health = x;
                if (health <= 0) {
                    die();
                }
            };
            let attack = enemy => {
                if (level < enemy.getLevel()) {
                    damage(1);
                    console.log(`${enemy.getName()} has damaged ${name}`);
                }
                if (level >= enemy.getLevel()) {
                    enemy.damage(1);
                    console.log(`${name} has damaged ${enemy.getName()}`);
                }
            };
            return { attack, damage, getLevel, getName };
        };
        let clair = Player("Claire", 11);
        let flaire = Player("flaire", 8);
        clair.attack(flaire);
        flaire.damage(0);
        console.log(flaire.getLevel(), flaire.getName());
        console.log(flaire.health, clair.health); // undefined, undefined
        flaire.die // not exposed to use
        flaire.health = -2000; // not exposed to use
        // those things(die,health) are not exposed publicly so we would get an undefined error, this is a very good thing
        // setting up objects like this makes it eassire for us to use them because we've actually out some thought into it how and when we are going to want to use that information, because logic is encapsulated

        // Inheritance with Factory Functions, concept of Prototypes and inheritance or giving our objects access to methods or properties of another object
        // there are few easy ways to do so using Factory Functions:
        Person = name => {
            let sayName = () => console.log("Name : " + name);
            return { sayName };
        };
        let Nerd = name => {
            // simply create a person and pull out sayName() with destructuring assignment syntax
            let { sayName } = Person(name);
            let doSomethingWithNerd = () => { console.log("Nerd stuff") };
            return { sayName, doSomethingWithNerd };
        }
        flaire = Nerd("flaire");
        flaire.sayName();
        flaire.doSomethingWithNerd();
        // that pattern is awesome because it allows you to pick and choose which functions you want to include in your new object
        // it can also be done using Object.assign: here is a snippet for understanding copying accessors:
        let obj = {
            foo: 1,
            get bar() {
                return 2;
            },
            baz() {
                return 4;
            }
        };
        let copy = Object.assign({}, obj);
        console.log(copy); // value copy.bar is obj.bar's getter's return value
        console.log(copy.bar, obj.bar, copy.baz(), obj.baz());
        //  using that Object.assign into our Factory Function implmentation from earlier when copying them into our returning objct:
        Nerd = name => {
            let prototype = Person(name);
            let doSomethingWithNerd = () => console.log("Nerdy stuff");
            // return Object.assign({}, prototype, doSomethingWithNerd);
            return Object.assign({}, prototype, { doSomethingWithNerd });
        }
        clair = Nerd("claire");
        clair.sayName();
        clair.doSomethingWithNerd();
        // factory function using Object.create(): any function can create new objects, when it's not a constructro function it's a Factory function:
        let someProto = {
            hello() {
                console.log("Hello " + this.name);
            },
            helloAgain() {
                return "Hello " + this.name;
            }
        };
        let greeter = name => Object.assign(Object.create(someProto), {
            name
        });
        clair = greeter("claire");
        clair.hello();
        let msg = clair.helloAgain();
        console.log(msg);
        // one major drawback to delegation is that it's not very good for storing state, if you try to store state in objects/arrays, 
        // mutating it in for any member wil mutate for every instance that shares this same prototype, to preserve safety, make a copy of state for each object
        // Concatenative Inheritance/Cloning/Mixins: concatenative inheritance is a process of copyingproperties from one object to another without retaining a reference between teo objects
        // cloning is an awesome way to store default state for objects, this process is commoly achieved by using Object.assign():
        someProto = {
            hello: function hello() {
                console.log("Hello " + this.name);
            },
            helloAgain: function () {
                console.log("Hello " + this.name);
            }
        };
        flaire = Object.assign({}, someProto, { name: "flaire" });
        flaire.hello();
        flaire.helloAgain();
        // concatenative inheritance is very powerful and gets even better whn used with closures
        // Functional Inheritance also makes use of a Factory function and then tacks on new propertiesusing concatenative inheritance
        let barker = state => ({
            bark: () => console.log("Woof, " + state.name)
        });
        let driver = state => ({
            drive: () => state.position = state.position + state.speed
        });
        let killer = state => ({
            shout: () => console.log("Killer robot Dog " + state.name)
        });
        barker({ name: "todd" }).bark();
        let murderRobotDog = name => {
            let state = {
                name,
                speed: 1100,
                position: 4,
            };
            return Object.assign(
                {},
                barker(state),
                driver(state),

        murderRobotDog("KillerRobot").shout();
        console.log(murderRobotDog("KilelrRobot").drive());

        // Module Pattern, modules are very similar to Factory functions, main difference is how they're created:
        let calculator = ( () => {
            let add = (a,b) => a+b;
            let sub = (a,b) => a-b;
            let mul = (a,b) => a*b;
            let div = (a,b) => a/b;
            return {
                add,
                sub,
                mul,
                div
            };
        })();
        console.log(calculator.add(5,4), calculator.sub(5,4), calculator.mul(5,4), calculator.div(5,4));
        // concept of Module Pattern is exactly same as Factory Function, however instead of creating a factory that we can use over and over again to createe mmuliple object, module pattern wraps Factory Function in an IIFE
        // primary reason to use IIFE is to obtain data privacy, any variables declared within IIFE cannot be accessed from outside of that IIFE scope:
        (function() {
            let foo = "bar";
            console.log(foo);
        })();
        // console.log(foo); // not accessible
        //  it's apparently not much differnet than normal function except it doesn't ytake up namespace for accidentally called up on more than once as it intended to be
        // IIFE can also take up arguments into it as parameeters as well
        let foo1 = "foo";
        (function(innerFoo) {
            console.log(innerFoo, foo1)
        })(foo1);
