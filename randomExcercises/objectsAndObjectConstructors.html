        // objects as a design pattern
        // consider these two models:
        // model 01:
        let p1Name = "tim";
        let p2Name = "jenn";
        let p1Marker = "X";
        let p2Marker = "O";
        // model 02:
        let playerOne = {
            name: "tim",
            marker: "X"
        };
        let playerTwo = {
            name: "jenn",
            marker: "O"
        };
        // consider an ecommerce site product where keeping track of all these related information regarding any product so vital that individual naming like first model is unfeasible
        // and that brings us to Object Constructors: when you have a specefic Object type and need to duplicate it often times then Constructor functions are way to go:
        function Player(name, marker) {
            this.name = name;
            this.marker = marker
        }
        let player01 = new Player("rene", "X"); // calling function with new will create an instance of that Function
        console.log(player01.name, player01.marker);
        // just like object literal, it's possible to have object methods in it:
        function Player(name, marker) {
            this.name = name;
            this.marker = marker;
            this.sayName = function () {
                console.log(name);
            }
        }
        let player02 = new Player("hana", "O");
        player01.sayName();
        player02.sayName();

        // Excercises:
        // write a constructor for making Book objects with title, author, numOfPages and whether you have read that book or not
        function Book(title, author, pages, read) {
            this.title = title;
            this.author = author;
            this.pages = pages;
            this.read = read;
            this.info = function () {
                return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, ${this.pages} pages, ${this.read}`;
            }
        }
        let theHobbit = new Book("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 295, "have not read yet");
        console.log(theHobbit.info());
        // it's best to define functions on "prototype" othat object, if we declare function directly into constructor functions like we did in our Book function it could weigh in over time for many more methods inclucing into it
        // as new objects creatd from that constructor function will be duplicated overtime over for new objects and for thusands of objects optimizationa like that can go a long way

        // Recommended Method for Prototypal Inheritance:
        function Student(name, grade) {
            // this.name = name;
            // this.grade = grade;
            this.name = name;
            this.grade = grade;
        }
        Student.prototype.sayName = function() {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
        function EighthGrader(name) {
            // this.name = name;
            this.name = name;
            this.grade = 8;
        }
        EighthGrader.prototype = Object.create(Student.prototype);
        // this doesn't work, because it literally set left side to right sided but not a copy, which coud cause problem if you needed to edit something in future
        // EighthGrader.prototype = Student.prototype;
        let carla = new EighthGrader("carla");
        carla.sayName();
        console.log(carla.grade);

        // consider one more example:
        function Student() {}
        Student.prototype.sayName = function() {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
        function EighthGrader(name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.grade = 8;
        }
        // do not do this
        EighthGrader.prototype = Student.prototype;
        function NinthGrader(name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.grade = 9;
        }
        // not again
        NinthGrader.prototype =  Student.prototype;
        NinthGrader.prototype.sayName = function() {console.log("Gotcha hahahaha")};
        carla = new EighthGrader("carla");
        carla.sayName(); // because we editted shared function name
        //  if we would have used Object.create, then this function editing wouldn't overwritte and intervene one another
        // NinthGrader.prototype =  Object.create(Student.prototype);
        // carla =  new EighthGrader("carla");
        // carla.sayName();
