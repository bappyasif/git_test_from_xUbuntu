        // Continuations, the callback function wraps or encapsulates continuation of program
        // as soon as we introduce single continuation in form of callback function, we've allowed a divergence to form between our Brains work and way our code will work, which becomes hardder to understand, reason, debug and maintain

        // Sequential Brain, when we fake multitasking, such as typing and talking to a friend or family what we're actually most likely doing is acting as fast context switchers, we switch back and forthbetween two or more tasks in rapid succession
        // simulatneous progress in each task in tiny , fast little chunks, we do it so fast that to outside workd it seems to be parallel, its(e.g. Our Brain) work kind of Event Loop queue

        // Doing Versus Planning, there's a big observable difference between how we Plan various Tasks and how our brain actually operates those Tasks
        // even though at operational level our Brains are async evented, we seem to plan out task in a sequential, synchronous way (e.g. A then B then C), we assume to exteent temporal blocking(e.g. blocking B to wait on A and C to wait on B)

        // Nested or Chained Callbacks
        listen("click", function handler(evt) {
            setTimeout(function request() {

                    if (data === "hello") {

        // this kind of chain of mutiple functions together often called as callback hell or pyramid of doom
        // "callback hell" has nothing to do with nesting/indentation, it's much deeper problem than taht which we'll come to understand shortly

            }
        }
        // even though it's much cleaner and hardly any nesting/indentation but still a "callback hell"
        // as we go linearly reason about this code, we've to skip from one function to next andd to next and bounce all around tp keep track sequence of code
        // for example if step 2 fails, step 3 never gets reacched nor does step 2 retry or move on to an alternative error handling flow and so on
        // with hardcoded callbacks even with error handling is often far less optimized, once specifying all eventualities, code becomes convoluted tat it's hard to ever maintain or update it, and thats "callback hell" is alll about

        // Tale of Five Callbacks, to illustrate hazards of trust at play, with an exaggerated scenerio
        //  consider you have a callback function through a third arty vendor utility function that you pass in your purchaseData and then charges customer CC and displays Thank you page
        analytics.trackPurchase(purchaseData, function () {
            chargeCreditCard();
            displayThankYouPage();
        });
        // but situation might arrive that due to Third Part utility function your code behaving unexppectedly and to stop it from happening again you bring adjustments in your code like this
        let tracked = false;
        analytics.trackPurchase(purchaseData, function () {
            if (!tracked) {
                tracked = true;
                chargeCreditCard();
                displayThankYouPage();
            }
        });
        // we're essentially creating a "latch" to handle if there might happen to be multiple occurent of our callback function
        // but still due to using third party utility function and they could bring in many different changes in their code base causing many ad hoc situatin upfront which is not always easy and affordable thing to do at all times, hence "callback hell" can be very cumbersome to handle

        // overly trusting of inputs
        function addNumbers(x, y) {
            // + s overloaded with coercion t be string concatenation
            return x + y;
        }
        addNumbers(21, 21); // 42
        addNumbers(21, "21") // "2121"
        // defensive against untrusted input
        function addNumbers(x, y) {
            // ensure numerical
            if (typeof x !== "number" || typeof y !== "number") {
                throw Error("Bad Parameters");
            }
            return x + y;
        }
        addNumbers(21, 21); // 42
        addNumbers(21, "21") // Error: "Bad Parameters"

        // or perhaps even safer

            return Number(x) + Number(y);
        }
        addNumbers(21, 21); // 42
        addNumbers(21, "21") // 42
        // these sorts of checks/normalizations are fairly common on function inputs, can be coined with term Trust But Verify
        // doesn't it stand to reason that we should do this same for our async composition as well
        // callbacks usually dont really offers us anything to assist us with as such, we've to construct all that machinery for ourselves and it often ends up being repeated boilerplate code for every single async function call
        // also known as "Inversion of Control" along those trust trust lines for any kind of eternal utility functions usage and defense against any kind of pitfalls there might be

        // Saving Callbacks, there are several variations of callback designs that have attempted to address some of those trust issues

        // ajax("https://some.url", success, failure);
        // this split-callback is what JS Promises uses in ES6 Promise API
        // another common pattern is called error-first-style used nearly across all Node.JS API's, where first argument is reserved for an error if here is any, If success then this argument will be empty/falsy
