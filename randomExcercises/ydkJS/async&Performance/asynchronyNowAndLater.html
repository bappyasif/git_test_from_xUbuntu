        // });

        // even though synchronous ajax call can be made but it's highly discouraged because it'll stop any kind of UI enteraction until request is complete

        }
        let answer = now(); // runs rightaway
        setTimeout(later, 110); // runs after a await
        // whenever you're creating a later chunk of your code that should be executed in response to some event(timer, mouse click, Ajax response, and so on) and thus introducing Asynchrony to your program

        // Async Console
        let a = {
            index: 1
        };
        // should show {index:1} but in some browser due to next statement it might show {index:2}, when you do run into this kind of scenario it's beest to use breakpoint in your JS debugger instead of relying your console output
        console.log(a);
        a.index++;

        // Event Loop
        // JS engines itself has never done anything more than execute a singl chunk of you program at any givn time, when asked to, but by whom you should ask, that's important
        // JS engine doesn't run in isolation, it runs inside a hosting environment, usually for most developers it's web browser, though JS has expanded beyond browser into other environment such as servers via like Node.js and gets embedded into other devices from robots to lightbulbs
        // each environment has one thing in common for executing multiple chunks of your program over a time, invoking JS engine at each moment, called Event Loop
        // JS has an on demand execution environment for any arbitary snippet of JS, it has always scheduled "Events" or JS code instructions
        // for example when you make an Ajax call yo setup your response code in a callback function and JS engine tells environment, susupend execution until you finish that network request and you have some data or not please call this callback function right after immediately
        // browser then is setup and ready to listen for any response from network and when it has anything to give to you, it schedules callvback function to be executed by inserting into Event Loop
        // Event Loop Psuedo Code
        let eventLoop = []; // first in first out
        let event;
        while (1 === 0) {
            if (eventLoop.length > 0) {
                // get next event in queue
                event = eventLoop.shift();
                // now, execute next event
                try {
                    event(); // function callbacks
                } catch (err) {
                    reportError(err)
                }
            }
        }
        // it's important to note setTimeout doesn't put your callback into event loop queue rather it sets upa  time and once expires environment pushes it back to event loop.
        // if you've multiple setTimeout items in event loop, it gets in line and awit for it's timer to expire and that's why it might sometime not accurately begin at expiration time but rather depend on state of event queue and execute between that time and after
        // due to ES6 Promises, JS engines now specifies how Event Loop works rather previously it was just Hosting Environment purrpose

        // Parallel Threading, async is about gap between now and then, but parallel is to occur simultaneously
        // most common tools for parallel computing are processes and threads, and may execute simultaneously on seperate processors or computers, but multiple threads can share memory of a single process.
        // an event loop in contrast breaks it's works into chunks and executes them in serial, thus disallowing parallel access and changes to shared memory
        // paralleelism and serialism can coexist in form of cooperating event loops in separate threads, this interleaving between these two occur at very different level of granularity
        function later() {
            answer = answer * 2;
            console.log("Meaning of life: ", answer);
        }
        // in a single threaded environment, it really doesn't mater that items in it are low level operations because nothing can interrupt this thread, whereas in a parallel system two or mutiple threads are operating in same program could likely have unpredictable behavior
        a = 20;
        function foo() {
            a = a + 1;
        }
        function bar() {
            a = a * 2;
        }
        // ajax("https://soome.url", foo);
        // ajax("https://soome.url", bar);
        // in a single threaded behavior foo runs first and hence results 42 but if bar ran first then result would be 41 instead
        // when JS events sharing sam data in parallel unpredictability would be much more subtle
        // it's a good thing that JS never shares dat across threads, which means level of nondeterminism isn't a concern to worry about
        // not all nondeterminism is bad sometimes it can be intentional!!

        // Run-to-Completion, due to JS's single-threading, code inside of foo() gets runs first at its entirety before running bar or vice versa, this is called run-to-completion behavior
        a = 1;
        let b = 2;
        function foo() {
            a++;
            b = b * a;
            a = b + 3;
        }
        function bar() {
            b--;
            a = 8 + b;
            b = a * 2;

        foo();
        bar();
        console.log(a, b); // outcome of scenario 1
        bar();
        foo();
        console.log(a, b); // outcome of scenario 2
        // two outcomes from same code means we still have nondetermnism but it's at function(event) ordering level rather theen statement ordering level as it is with threads, it's mroe deterministic than threads would have been
        // function ordring nondeterminism is also known as "race condition", as they are raacing against each other and determing what final value of a and b will be due to that

        // Concurrency, when two or more processes (or tasks) are running simulataneously over same period of time, regardless whether their individual constituent operations happens in parallel or not
        // you can think of concurrency as process level(taskk level) parallelism as opposed to operation level parallelism (separate-processor threads)
        // it's possible to think that sometimes request and response can occur at same moment which will then move onto Even loop through run-to-completion one by one
        // single threaded event loop is one expression of concurrency(task-level parallel) along with some others.

        // Noninteracting, when two or more processes are interleaving concurrently and they dont interact with each other then nondeterminism is perfectly acceptable
        // foo and bar are two concurrent prossess and nondeterminate which order they will be fired in, if they act independently then it doesn't matter because they act independently and need not ot interact

        // Interaction, more commonly when concurrent processes will by necessity interact through scope or dom, and to prevent race conditions we'll have to coordinate these interactions.

        // ajax("https://some.url/1", response);
        // ajax("https://some.url/2", response);
        // res[] will have different results dpending on which request finishes first, you can say nondeterminism is a race conditions bug
        // sometimes one task can always takes much longer than that other depending on nature of their task, to address such race condition you can co ordinate interaction in certain order
        res = [];
        function response(data) {

        // Cooperation, or also known as cooperative concurrency, is to break up a long runnig process into smaller chunks so that other concurrent "processes" can have a chance to interleaved their operation into Event Loop queue
        // consider an Ajax response that needs to run through a long list of results to transform values
        res = [];
        // receives array of results from that Ajax Call

        // to make it more cooperatively concurrent system, one that's friendlier and doesn't hog event loop queue, process these results in Asynchronous Batches, after each "yielding" back to event loop to let other waiting process to run

        // by processing in chunks it'll ensure a short running "process" even if itmeans many subsequent processes as interleaving onto event loop queue, this will give us more responsive site/app
        // setTimeout(..) is a hack for Asynch Scheduling, which means just place it for next opportunity at event loop queue to run this process

        // Jobs, a new consept on top of event loop queue is Job Queue and it's used mostly for Asynch Behavior with Promises
        // it's best to think that Jobs Queue is a queue hanging at end of every tick in event loop queue and it's telling "here is this other thing I need to do, but make sure this runs right away before anything else can happen"
        // another metaphor can be used to understand Jobs Queue, event loop is like a park ride when finished you go back to end of line to ride again, where as Jobs Queue is like finishing its ride then cutting in line and getting right back on for next ride
        // A Job can cause more Jobs to be added to same queue, and could spin indefinitely thus starving program of ability to move on to next event loop tick, same as runing a long or even an infinite loop in your code
        // let's imagine an API for scheduling Jobs directly and call it schedule(..)
        console.log("A");
        setTimeout(() => console.log("B"),0);
        // theoretical "Job API"
        schedule(() => {
            console.log("C");
            schedule(() => console.log("D"))
        });
        // you might expect to display ABCD but it'll print ACDB, because Jobs happens at the end of current event loop tick and timer fires to schedule next, if available, event loop tick

        // Statement Reordering, while JS semantics thankfully protect us from this observable discrepancies that Compiler Statement Reordering would seem to be in danger of but it's important understand how tenuous link there is 
        // between sourced is authored from top down fashion and way it runs after compilation, Compiler Statement Reordering can be a metaphor for concurrency and interaction, awareness of it can help you understand async JS code flow issues better
