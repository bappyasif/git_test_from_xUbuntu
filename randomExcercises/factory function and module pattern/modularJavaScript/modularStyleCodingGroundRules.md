Some Modular Style Coding Ground Rules:
- self-contaained module
  - everything to do with module at hand is within module
  - no global variables usage
  - if a modulemanages more than one thing it should be splitted up
- separation of concerns
- DRY Code: as in Don't Repeate Yourself
- effecient DOM usage
  - very few $('selectors')
- no memory leaks
  - all events can be unbounded
